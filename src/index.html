      <p>
        This year, I am excited to delve into my passion for front-end
        development and data science. While on my internship this summer, I was
        thrown into React, JavaScript, and MUI so I hope to bolster my
        foundational skills in HTML and CSS in this class. By doing so, I am
        seeking to develop a greater understanding of web development and round
        out my technical abilities.
